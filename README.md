# README

Blogger is my first real rails app project where I created a simple blog system and learned
the basics of Ruby on Rails including:


* MVC (Models, Views, Controllers)
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Adding gems for extra features

This is all done within The Odin Project with tutorial http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html#blogger-2
